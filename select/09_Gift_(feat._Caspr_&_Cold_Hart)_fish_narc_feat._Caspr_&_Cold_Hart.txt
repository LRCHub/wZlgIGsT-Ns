Cold Hart, baby (Caspr)
(I'm a punk star, bitch, I feel like fish narc)

I could send a gift, hope you get well (Oh)
I could kiss you, I would never tell (Tell)
I'ma stay smooth, keep to myself (Oh)
I'ma stay smooth, keep to myself, I (Oh)
I could send a gift, hope you get well (Oh, oh)
I could kiss you, I would never tell (Oh)
I'ma stay smooth, keep to myself (Oh)
I'ma stay smooth, keep to myself, I (Oh)

Spend days dancing under club lights
We wait, I don't wanna rush time
Can't say that I deserve a love life
Blow slits on my wrist to a tough guy
Gold fangs, call me Coldy Skylark
Up late grinding like I'm dark slime
Shot up in the sky and I pray to no one
Heart beating fast, baby, let the car run
And just wait for me right here
And we might not make it, dear
So tonight just make it clear
Send a gift, ayy

I could send a gift, hope you get well (Oh)
I could kiss you, I would never tell (Tell)
I'ma stay smooth, keep to myself (Oh)
I'ma stay smooth, keep to myself, I (Oh)
I could send a gift, hope you get well (Oh, oh)
I could kiss you, I would never tell (Oh)
I'ma stay smooth, keep to myself (Oh)
I'ma stay smooth, keep to myself, I (Oh)

Miss you and I hope you get well, and I
Your bonus, I'ma spend it on Chanel, and I
Caspr, name ring bells, uh
Do drugs in the hotels, yeah
I don't want Rollies, I don't got no time
True Religion cowboy, baby, let's ride
Let's ride, baby, will you hit my line?
Wanna fuck on you, wanna waste my time
Every single night, baby, I feel fine
When you creep back up, back in my mind
And my phone been dead, so it's just like me
Said I'd be there soon, that was half past three

I could send a gift, hope you get well (Oh)
I could kiss you, I would never tell (Tell)
I'ma stay smooth, keep to myself (Oh)
I'ma stay smooth, keep to myself, I (Oh)
I could send a gift, hope you get well (Oh, oh)
I could kiss you, I would never tell (Oh)
I'ma stay smooth, keep to myself (Oh)
I'ma stay smooth, keep to myself, I (Oh)
