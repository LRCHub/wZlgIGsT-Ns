I know it's getting harder not to be around
But if the trouble's wasted, your shadow's on the ground
Ahhh

And when you look into my eyes and tell me why
I'm happily abandoned - your shadow's doing fine
Ahhh

The gift that now belongs to me, I hold up high
A dull misunderstanding that leads into a fight

See what you can't see
Know what I now know
Oh

I think about it all the time - I hope it shows
We rarely get to be there - that's just the way it goes
Oh
And with this sip, I've come between you and your law
The trouble wasn't wasted- I'll see you in the fall
