It's a twelve o'clock depression
My mind is in recession
And I can't answer you
It's a day I can't remember
I think it's late September
Or is it April blue, yeah?

I can't find peace of mind in a world that's so unkind
It's just a little heart breaker, just a little heart breaker, yeah

It's a sticky situation when I'm near hallucination
And I refuse to bow
They used to think me funny when I promised them their money
But they're not laughing now

I can't find peace of mind, then she calls me just in time
She's a gift with a golden gun and she's got them on the run
She's a gift with a golden gun, 'cause she knows what they've done

I can't find peace of mind, then she calls me just in time
She's a gift with a golden gun and she's got them on the run
She's a gift with a golden gun, 'cause she knows what they've done

Just what they've done, done, done, done, done
What they've done, done, done, done, done
Just what they've done, done, done, done, done
Done, done, done done, done
