This instrument can teach, it can illuminate
Yes and it even can inspire
But it can do so only to the extent that
Humans are determined to use it to those ends
Otherwise, it's nothing but wires and lights in a box

Running, rushing, blood spilling
Tears are pouring, it seems the well is never filled
Mentally exhausted, overworking, take another pill
All to keep the owner of the corporation stacking billions
These corporations manipulating our daily lives
Got us exasperated working through all of our days and nights
Sacrifices your leisure time to end up at a 9 to 5
To work until you are deceased without a single moment for peace
Never still, it just keeps rolling down the hill
Nobody tries to stop it
Dont get cocky get you killed, you'll be a trending topic
A cog up in the wheel
A sacrifice to the cult of death being built
Caught up in the matrix, virtual digital minds
We don't memorize phone numbers or directions when we drive
We don't even have to go shopping to get our food and buy things
We only push a button, we don't even have to try
Can't even lift an eye up away from my phone
Talking to Instagram live just so I don't feel alone
Flooding my Twitter feed with my deepest feelings and thoughts
My page is public but my sense of conversation is blocked
I validate myself through followers just to feel important
Instead of living in the moment, I much rather record it
Nobody knows my first name but know my Snapchat handle
I'm just a millennial trapped in social media standards

C-O-N-F-O-R-M
I see oppression within an effort
C-O-N-F-O-R-M
To own the rights of my expression
C-O-N-F-O-R-M
I see expression, influence, the feeling
C-O-N-F-O-R-M
To wipe our opinions, we are the meaning of conforming

Shelling out melodies and feverish frequencies
Funding boardroom salaries, they pay me in exposure
No penalties when they're late paying me
No benefits seen, just means for you to leave the whore foreclosure
Advertise that revenue, everything that you consume
All for them, less for you, they do all the sorting
Try to figure out ways to make you feel important
While they keep robbing you blind, hold extortion
In some sense that's the power of the Internet
On the other hand, that's a perfect formula for the dark side
This is our generation's form of nuclear power
How we deal with this will be the stuff in history

C-O-N-F-O-R-M
I see oppression within an effort
C-O-N-F-O-R-M
To own the rights of my expression
C-O-N-F-O-R-M
I see expression, influence, the feeling
C-O-N-F-O-R-M
To wipe our opinions, we are the meaning of conformity
